This mission covers a wide range of responsibilities throughout the report publishing cycle, including:<br/>\n</p><p>\n- Finding and on-boarding data contributors for the report - the DBIR would not be possible if not for the data contributors that we have for incident and non-incident data. Creating new relationships with potential contributors and managing the relations with new ones is crucial for the report to be able to have enough data samples to minimize biases and other damaging data-related vices.<br/>\n</p><p>\n- Analyzing and normalizing data - the DBIR incident data is normalized and organized around the VERIS framework (veriscommunity.net). All Core Team members use VERIS to normalize and register the incidents that are to be reviewed for the report, and ar also responsible for its continuous improvement to better represent the growing and evolving threat landscape. The data, once normalized, is queried and analyzed through a programmatic interface in R that provides primitives for charts and statistical tests for all team members to use.<br/>\n</p><p>\n- Writing reports and assisting in supporting its launch - Once the data is analyzed, the report sections are written, set on publishing layout and reviewed to make sure the report statements are correct and supported by the underlying data, including the development of fact checking documents.

The term \u201csexual exploitation\u201d means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term \u201csexual abuse\u201d means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term \u201csexual harassment\u201d means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator\u2019s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.
